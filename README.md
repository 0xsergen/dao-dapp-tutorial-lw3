Building DAO
a DAO for holders of CryptoDevs NFTs. From the ETH that was gained through the ICO, DAO Treasury is built up. The DAO now has some ETH, but currently does nothing with it.
It is allowed NFT holders to create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an NFT marketplace, and speculate on price.
